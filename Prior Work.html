            I've done the following photography shoots across the Bay Area, NYC, Boston! Each of the Commissions
        features its own purpose. Senior Portraits are for individual empowerment while engagements are
        for capturing those romantic moments with your life partner.

        Engagements are a treasured milestone, while dance showcase photography captures a sense of community and artistry within
        yourself and your fellow teammates. 

        To me, photography is not just "taking" a photo, but it's a reflection of how we see the world, empower others,
        and bring stories and moments to life.

        With hundreds of clients across these regions, I attribute my creative growth to those who trusted me in capturing their special moments 
        and empowering them <3!

            <h3>More about my journey</h3>

            <p>
                I always strive to expand upon my creative abilities and exposure to "new" or uniqu types of photography.
                For example, I recently joined the Northeastern Tastemakers magazine and photographed my first 2 concerts with them
                for artists such as Ben Barnes and Tiffany Day in Boston!

                I'm proud about taking these risks and hope to continually be creative and analytical. Some people didn't believe
                in me when I first started this artistic journey, but looking back.,. it's been inspiring and heartwarming to see
                that 1. my risk paid off, 2. I am actively improving something I really care about and 3. that I get to put a smile on people's faces during my sessions.

                Thank you!! <3
